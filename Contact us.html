<h2><u>Chambers Coffee Co.</u></h2>

<p class="undecided">Chambers Coffee Co. was established by my father in early 1950, and since then we have been serving our coffee accross London. The company originally started as a coffee shop situated a short distance from what is now the Olympic Park at Stratford. But the company fell into tough times in the 1960's and in 1967 my father decided the company no longer needed a fixed location- mainly due to the extautionate rent being charged. I worked alongside my father for many years to gain his level of expertise and took over the company in 1994. Since then we have focused on one day having a 100% 'Green' mobile cafe. </p>

<h2><u>Sustainability here at Chambers Coffee Co.</u></h2>

<p class="correct">
	We believe sustainability to be key, and thats why we have converted our coffee van to run on biofuel, helping to reduce emmisions one coffee at a time. We only use recylced cups, lids and spoons, as every good coffee retailer should.</p>

<h2><u>How could you help?</u></h2>

<p class="undecided">Coffee has many uses and as we try to encourage our customers to reduse, reuse, recycle as much as we possible. Hence why we have started the 'Coffee Grounds scheme' which basically means that we collect all our coffee grounds and share them out to be reused, please see the list of uses below; </p>

<ul>
  <li>Fertiliser- to improve water retention and aeration.</li>
  <li>Natural Pest Repellent</li>
  <li>Compost- coffee grounds contain nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.</li>
  <li>Meat tenderiser- since the grounds have a high acid content.</li>
  <li>Homemade Candles</li>
  <li>Deodoriser- place the coffee grounds in a bag in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Exfoliate- coffee grounds make a great exfoliator.</li>
  <li>Cleaning fireplaces- sprinkle over ash to make cleaning easier.</li>
  <li>Natural Abrasive- use to scrub off stuck on food.</li>
  <li>Reduce Cellulite- by stimulating circulation and temporarily dilates blood vessels.</li>
  <li>Give items a 'vintage' look.</li>
  <li>Use as a seasoning- can add a smoky flavour.</li>
  <li>Reduce dark circles and bags- to help get ride of under-eye bags.</li>
  <li>Make soap</li>
  <li>Repel fleas on a pet</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="simple">Please make enquiries for used coffee grounds to the barista.</h2>
